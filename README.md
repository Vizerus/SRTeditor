# SRT Subtitle Timing Adjuster

sup y'all! this is a super simple tool to shift all subtitles in an .srt file by any amount of seconds you want.

alternatively you can manually edit them in the adjusted preview.. but modifying the global delay will reset your manual changes atm so care.

i made it real quick bc i realized the subtitles are out of sync on a movie i was watching with the fam on vacation, hope it helps someone!

## how to use
1. extract the main folder somewhere
2. open `index.html` in your browser
3. follow the steps on the screen: pick your srt, set the delay, hit process, preview, download
4. you can tweak the delay on the fly or edit the adjusted subs before downloading

## files
- `index.html` — open this to do ya thang
- `styles.css` — makes it look nice(r)
- `script.js` — does the work

## todo (maybe one day xd)
- drag & drop srt file
- dark mode
- support for other subtitle formats
- batch process multiple files
- auto-detect offset
- error catching
- video uploading for live preview
- mobile tweaks
