# SRT Subtitle Timing Adjuster

sup y'all! this is a super simple tool to shift all subtitles in an .srt file by any amount of seconds you want.

alternatively you can manually edit them in the adjusted preview

## how to use
1. extract the main folder somewhere
2. open `index.html` in your browser
3. follow the steps on the screen: pick your srt, set the delay, hit process, preview, download
4. you can tweak the delay on the fly or edit the adjusted subs before downloading

## files
- `index.html` — the app
- `styles.css` — makes it look nice
- `script.js` — does the work

## todo (maybe)
- drag & drop srt file
- dark mode
- support for other subtitle formats
- batch process multiple files
- auto-detect offset
- error catching
- video uploading for live preview
- mobile tweaks
